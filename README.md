## Updates 🔥

We developed an interface to improve document accessibility for users with visual impairments. Our approach integrates a Document Layout Analysis (DLA) detection model with the ChatGPT API to generate a coherent reading order. The extracted metadata is then presented through tactile display interfaces for enhanced user interaction. 🚀!

- **08/10/2024**: 📄 Added dataset images.
